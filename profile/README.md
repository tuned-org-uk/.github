👋 Welcome 📺🛰️
   - I am [@Mec-iS](https://github.com/Mec-iS) and I do AI research engineering from London, UK
   - The main effort of this organisation is to build the next generation of vector databases, ready for the challenges of modern context architecting
   - You can read my seminal paper on Spectral Indexing at JOSS -> [link to paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.09002)
   - I provide services for companies willing to tackle properly the era of LLMs, see my sponsorship tiers -> https://github.com/sponsors/tuned-org-uk 💰

I work on systems for safer AI Agents and **LLM-focused technologies in databases**. I develop libraries with minimalism as design principle.

Please take a look at:
* [`arrowspace`](https://crates.io/crates/arrowspace) and [`pyarrowspace`](https://github.com/tuned-org-uk/pyarrowspace): a paper and a repository for a graph-based approach to vector search, inspired by current research on metamaterials
* [`smartcore`](https://crates.io/crates/smartcore): a Machine Learning library in Rust
* [`genegraph-storage`](https://github.com/tuned-org-uk/genegraph-storage): a storage layer for matrices and graph data
* [`javelin`](https://github.com/tuned-org-uk/javelin-tui): a data tool for graph exploration using the Lance file format
* [`nanogpt-rs`](https://github.com/tuned-org-uk/nanogpt-rs): a porting in Rust of NanoGPT, the super-efficient LLM model
* [`optical-embeddings`](https://crates.io/crates/optical-embeddings): A Rust implementation for DeepSeek-OCR text to image compression
* [`bmpp-agents-rs`](https://github.com/Mec-iS/bmpp-agents-rs): a framework for safe AI-coding agents
* [`vibelang-rs`](https://github.com/Mec-iS/vibelang-rs): a Rust implementation of Meaning Typed Prompting, a protocol to represent prompting to human and LLMs

Please consider sponsoring me to improve your and your organisation's handle of LLMs.
